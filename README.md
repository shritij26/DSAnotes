# 💻CodeQuest: The DSA Chronicles⚔️

Welcome to the **most organized chaos** you'll ever see in the world of Data Structures and Algorithms!

This repository is a **one-stop cheatcode** to mastering DSA — forged in the fire of late-night bugs, WA verdicts, and the occasional `"Segmentation fault (core dumped)"`. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started, or someone prepping for placements, these notes will **recursively call your attention** and never return `NULL`.

## 📚 What's Inside? (a.k.a. My DSA Dump)

> Every topic in this repo has been tested, debugged, and occasionally cried over.

### ✅ **Core Concepts**
- 🔁 **Recursion** – All problems are solvable... with recursion and hope.
- ➡️ **Pointers** – Because sometimes, addressing your problems is good.
- 🔗 **Linked List (LL)** – Singly, but not lonely.
- 🔁 **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** – Forward and backward compatibility included.

### 🌲 **Hierarchical Structures**
- 🌳 **Trees** – From traversals to binary search... no shady stuff here.
- 🔥 **Heap** – Where we dump our priorities (min/max ones).
- 🧠 **Trie** – The most _prefix-ed_ structure ever.

### 🧮 **Maps & Graphs**
- 🔑 **HashMap** – Because who has time for linear search?
- 🕸️ **Graph** – Dijkstra, DFS, BFS... the usual suspects.

### 📦 **Algorithm Goodies**
- 🧠 **Dynamic Programming (DP)** – Save results, save life.
- 💰 **Greedy Algorithms** – Because being greedy is sometimes optimal.
- 🧩 **Important Algorithms** – Searching, sorting, and more power moves.

## 🚀 Final Word

This repo has more DSA than my brain could ever hold — so I dumped it all here.
